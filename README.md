# Offline Map SDK for Android

This project provides an Android SDK for displaying offline maps using OpenStreetMap. It allows users to view maps without an internet connection by using locally stored map tiles.

## Features

- Display offline maps based on OpenStreetMap data.
- Support for server-side downloadable maps.
- Intuitive user interface for easy map navigation.
- Performance optimization for low-bandwidth environments.
- Documentation and tutorial for easy integration into existing mobile applications.

## Implementation Details

The Offline Map SDK is implemented using the following key components:

1. **MapDataSource**: Handles the loading and management of map tile sources. It supports both local tile sources and server-side downloadable maps. You can customize the `MapDataSource` class to add your own tile sources or connect to server APIs for downloading map tiles.

2. **MapSDK**: Provides a simplified interface for integrating the offline map functionality into an Android application. The `MapSDK` class takes care of initializing the map view, setting up the tile source, and handling user interactions.

3. **MapStyle**: Allows customization of the map's visual style. The `MapStyle` class provides methods to apply different map styles such as terrain, satellite, or custom styles. You can modify the `MapStyle` class to add your own map styling options.

## Getting Started

To use the Offline Map SDK in your Android application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

https://github.com/saeedshahib/OpenStreetMapProject.git


2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Replace the placeholder map tiles with your own map tile source. You can provide local tile sources or configure online tile sources by updating the appropriate files. Refer to the documentation for more details.

4. Build and run the project on your Android device or emulator.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation and a step-by-step tutorial on how to use and integrate the Offline Map SDK into your Android application can be found in the `docs` directory. The documentation explains the various components, their usage, and provides examples for customization.
